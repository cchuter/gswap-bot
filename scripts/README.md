# GalaChain Scripts

## Prerequisites

Set these environment variables (for example in `.env`):

```
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
WALLET_ADDRESS=eth|...
TRANSFER_RECIPIENT=client|...
```

Optionally override:

```
GALA_API_BASE=https://api-galaswap.gala.com    # defaults to this value
GALA_FEE_CHANNEL=asset                         # defaults to asset
```

Install dependencies once with:

```
npm install
```

## Authorize Fee Credits

```
npm run authorize-fee -- <amount>
```

Example:

```
npm run authorize-fee -- 1
```

Signs and submits a `FeeAuthorizationDto` to credit the requested amount of GALA fee tokens on the configured channel.

This script calls the documented GalaConnect endpoint `/v1/channels/<channel>/AuthorizeFee`. Provide your wallet as either `eth|...` or a 0x address and adjust `GALA_API_BASE`/`GALA_FEE_CHANNEL` if you are targeting a non-default environment.

### Check the Fee for a Swap Operation

```
npm run check-fee -- <givingAmount> <receivingAmount> '<givingToken>' '<receivingToken>' [uses]
```

Example:

```
npm run check-fee -- 1000 2000 'GALA|Unit|none|none' 'SILK|Unit|none|none' 1
```

Calls `/v1/RequestTokenSwap/fee` with the supplied payload (omitting `uniqueKey` and `signature` as instructed) so you can inspect the current GalaChain fee for that swap. Set `WALLET_ADDRESS` if you want the request to include an `X-Wallet-Address` header.

### Submit a Swap Request

```
npm run request-swap -- <givingAmount> <receivingAmount> '<givingToken>' '<receivingToken>' [uses]
```

Example:

```
npm run request-swap -- 1000 2000 'GALA|Unit|none|none' 'SILK|Unit|none|none' 1
```

Signs and submits `/v1/RequestTokenSwap` using your `PRIVATE_KEY` and `WALLET_ADDRESS`. The script deterministically serializes the payload, derives `signerPublicKey` from your private key, and appends an autogenerated `uniqueKey` prefixed with `galaconnect-operation-`.

### Terminate a Swap Request

```
npm run terminate-swap -- <swapRequestId>
```

Example:

```
npm run terminate-swap -- '<swapRequestId_from_response>'
```

Signs and submits `/v1/TerminateTokenSwap` for the supplied `swapRequestId`. Provide the swap ID exactly as returned by the creation endpoint (it often contains control characters) and wrap it in quotes so the shell treats it as a single argument.
If the ID includes `\u0000` sequences, escape the backslashes (e.g. `"\\u0000..."`) or prefix it with `base64:` and pass a base64-encoded version.

## Transfer GALA Tokens

```
npm run transfer -- <amount>
```

Example:

```
npm run transfer -- 99
```

Signs a `TransferTokenDto` moving the specified amount of GALA from `WALLET_ADDRESS` to `TRANSFER_RECIPIENT`.

> **Note:** Make sure you have authorized enough fee credits before transferring; otherwise the transfer call will fail with `Failed to burnTokens fee`.

## Inspect GALA Pools

```
npm run fetch-swaps
```

Optional overrides:

```
GALA_POOL_BASE=GALA                       # pool symbol to filter on
GALA_EXPLORE_API_BASE=https://dex-backend-prod1.defi.gala.com
GALA_POOL_PAGE_LIMIT=20                  # per-page fetch limit (max 20)
```

The script queries the public `/explore/pools` API and prints every pool that involves the configured base token. For each pool it shows both token prices, liquidity (TVL), and recent 24h volume.
